# Home-Monitoring-System(on-going project)
Beginning development of a home monitoring system. 

Part 1 PIR example on a Raspberry Pi.

The program senses movements through a PIR sensor. A movement object
is created with the count and datetime passed in, this is stored in
a list. The list is saved to a file periodically. The program will
also flash an LED to show it has detected movement.
